Idea for methods:

Any Nodes has to be either on a set or a subpath

Just store the parent in every node.

Any Nodes on a set are only allowed to have one incoming connections

Any Nodes on a subpath that come after a Node or Subpath, may only have one connection.

Any Nodes coming after a set have an unknown amount of connections

To get the amount of connections after a set , just iterate over the entiere set, and count +1
if you:

Reach the end of a set (just nodes), count +1
Reach the end of a subpath, count +1
(This counter is kept in the set, that needs to be counted.
